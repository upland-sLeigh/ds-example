# Example Design Token Creation

This example uses Amazons Style-Dictionary to create tokens for multipul platfroms and brands.

### How it works

Style dictionary reads over values set in JSON files and the iterates through and builds design-tokens based on the details in 'config.js' which is used in 'scripts/build.js'.

To get start clone repo then:

- npm install
- npm run build

### Output

Design tokens are the placed into a dist folder and each brand has it own tokens for each patform and all contain 'global' tokens.

## NOTE:

This is just an example of some of the feature that style-dictionary and design systems in general are capable of.
